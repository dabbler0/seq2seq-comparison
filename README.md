## Comparing Hidden Representations of `seq2seq-attn` Models

This is a fork of `seq2seq-attn` meant to provide some additional tools for analysis of the hidden representations generated by `seq2seq-attn` models. To use, train two `seq2seq-attn` models (let's say `modelA` and `modelB`) and run:

```
th describe.lua --model modelA --src_file source_text.txt --out_file modelA-desc.t7
th describe.lua --model modelB --src_file source_text.txt --out_file modelB-desc.t7
```

Where `source_text.txt` is an input file like you would use for evaluation. This will produce two large file consisting of the embeddings generated by the two models on each token in the input. Then to run comparisons, run:

```
th compare.lua --A modelA-desc.t7 --B modelB-desc.t7 --out_file compare-A-B.t7
```

This will produce a file containing:
  - The covariance matrix
  - The correlation matrix

More statistics to come, ideally:
  - CCA decomposition of the correlation matrix
  - A componentwise bivariate mutual information matrix
  - A least-squares change-of-basis matrix
  - A least-squares orthogonal change-of-basis matrix
